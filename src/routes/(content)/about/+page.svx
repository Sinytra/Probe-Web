# About

**Sinytra Connector** is a compatibility layer that allows running Fabric mods on NeoForge.

Its goal is to bring the two platforms closer together, saving developers time and effort maintaining their mods for
multiple platforms at once, as well as allowing players to play all their favourite mods in one modpack.

## The team

projects related to cross-loader Minecraft modding with an emphasis on open-source principles and collaboration with the
community.

Our mission is to provide developers and users in modding with powerful and free tools to make their everyday lives
easier.
